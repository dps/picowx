# picowx
_An APRS radio powered raspberry pi pico-w weather station_.
Uses the aprs.fi API via your WiFi network to display weather reports transmitted via the [Automatic Packet Reporting System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_Packet_Reporting_System) â€“ local weather that's often not available via popular weather APIs. Simple captive-portal configuration UI and tuned for low power standby.

## Software
Most of the logic is implemented in micropython, but the dormant sleep mode requires custom C code. I've built a special version of pimoroni flavor micropython to add this functionality. You can find a flashable .uf2 file in this repo and look or tiner with the micropython changes directly in https://github.com/dps/micropython. https://github.com/dps/pimoroni-pico is a fork of pimoroni's micropython (with support for Inky pack) which pulls in my custom micropython and has a Github action / continuous build which produced that .uf2 file should you wish to reproduce it yourself.
